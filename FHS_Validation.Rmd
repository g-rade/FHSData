```{r}
## load packages and read in datasets (tidyverse, haven, and rio were the only packages that I actually needed for this)
library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(survminer)
library(haven)
library(survRM2)
library(readxl)

## reading in the data and renaming variables, not much wrangling required for this data
validation_data <- read_excel('Master Database.Revised FinalCohort.10Oct21.xlsx') %>% 
  rename(dead_days = POD...104, event_free = POD...106, last_con = POD...101, Event = 'Death/LVAD/Tx') 

## export data
export(validation_data, "validation.csv")
```
